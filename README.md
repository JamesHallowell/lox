# lox

A work-in-progress lox implementation in Rust (following [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/)). It deviates slightly from the language specified in the book as I've tweaked a few things to personal preference.

## Usage

Run one of the example programs:

```console
cargo run examples/fibonacci.lox
```

Run the REPL:

```console
cargo run
```
